# VideoProject
A video analyzer (Matlab):  
stabilization (using features extraction-SIFT based,matching, Homography computuation- using RANSAC, and backwrad mapping for each frame)
background subtraction (ussing median and GMM)
matting (using colorization method based kde, refinement binary mask according given new background image)
object tracking (particle filter based, based on piecewise linear motion, diffrent roi. using manual initialization)
